*Yet Another Smart Mirror (C#)*

## The idea
Everyone's making smart mirrors these days, android seems to be the most popular solution as tablets are cheap and plentiful. But given my recent C# kick lately, I wanted to create my first iteration in that. Plus, I've got a bunch of old laptops laying around collecting dust that need a purpose in life.

This repo will chronicle both branches of the journey, software and hardware in creating a smart mirror that works for me (and with any luck, you).

## The plan
- *Somehow* I'll mount a spare laptop behind a two way mirror.
- *Somewhere* sells two-way mirrors. I will buy one. Duh
- *Something* will be displayed on the mirror, I'll keep a running to do list of ideas below as I think of them.

As you can tell, this is well thought out and not impulsive at all.
