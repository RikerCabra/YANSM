*Yet Another Smart Mirror (C#)*

## The idea
Everyone's making smart mirrors these days, android seems to be the most popular solution as tablets are cheap and plentiful. But given my recent C# kick lately, I wanted to create my first iteration in that.

This repo will chronicle both branches of the journey, software and hardware in creating a smart mirror that works for me (and with any luck, you).
